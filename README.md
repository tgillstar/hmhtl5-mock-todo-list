HTML5 Mock ToDo List using SASS and Bootstrap
===========

The design is a single screen for a todo list with tasks grouped by month in the tray that makes up the sidebar. There is also a modal that appears when clicking on the name of a todo that can be closed by either clicking an action or clicking on the translucent layer between it and the page. Keep the following requirements in mind regarding implementation:

1. The page should start with the tray expanded, and can be collapsed with what is known as the "hamburger" icon - the three black horizontal lines in the main area.
2. Clicking a checkbox toggles it. The checkboxes need to have the same style as the design, not the default browser style. Using alternate elements is fine.
3. The modal should be vertically and horizontally centered in the page, even when actively resizing the page
4. Should look identical in the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. We're not concerned with IE or mobile devices at this point.
